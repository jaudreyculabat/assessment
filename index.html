                <h5><b>Tau Gamma Phi</b></h5>
                <p>Tau Gamma Phi also known as the Triskelions' Grand Fraternity, is a Fraternity established in the Philippines and one of the largest fraternities in the world Its members call themselves Triskelions.Their aim is to see a Fraternity System devoid of violence in lieu of the rampant violence pervading the university campus at the time of its founding, to avoid elitism if they can, and to earnestly propagate their fraternity's principles as their way of life. Based on these goals, the Triskelions categorized their formal group as a 'protest fraternity'. The Fraternity encourages its members to strive for spiritual growth and to organize socio-civic activities for the benefit of communities. The Fraternity believes that it must forge its members to embody qualities of leadership, commitment, persistence, trust, integrity, respect, and vision for them to achieve academic success and personal development. The Tau Gamma Phi is now one of the largest International fraternities with about a Million registered members(including Sigmas) worldwide. Its counterpart is called Tau Gamma Sigma (???) also known as the Triskelions' Grand Sorority. The Triskelion Alumni Organization (TAO) is the umbrella organization for all its alumni members. The TAO has established close-knit enclaves in the United States of America, the Middle East and some countries in Europe. The Triskelion Radio was set up by capable Triskelions, and it is probably the first ever fraternity and sorority on-line radio station in the Philippines.</p>

                <h5><b>Tau Gamma Sigma</b></h5>
                <p>Tau Gamma Sigma also known as the Triskelion Grand Sorority, is a sorority established in the Philippines. Its members call themselves Lady Triskelions.The Tau Gamma Sigma is the counterpart of the Tau Gamma Phi fraternity. It is now one of the largest and most dynamic sororities in the Philippines. In the year 1969 when the U.P. Tau Gamma Phi was still in its early stage of existence at the University of the Philippines campus, their main focus was setting a foothold in the university. They were not yet very concerned about establishing a female counterpart, but since a lot of female students and friends hanged around with them, who gave their support, attended social gatherings when invited, the Triskelion brothers quickly learned that having female counterpart can be very beneficial to the Fraternity especially in their recruitment campaign. They then encouraged their female friends and classmates to form a sorority that will be their partner not only in activities limited to school and community service programs but also in pursuing their goals to achieve academic success, personal development and spiritual growth. Most of the founding members of U.P. Tau Gamma Sigma also belonged to the U.P. Political Science Club along with the Founding Fathers and Founders Batch of the Tau Gamma Phi.</p>
